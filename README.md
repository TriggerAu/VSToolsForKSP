## Usage
Once installed the Extension will provide refactors and options to help with Mod development. The current list includes:
* Code Refactoring of strings to Localizer.Format calls (including writing the cfg files)
* Code Refactoring of strings to Localization Tags (including writing the cfg files)
* Templates to be able to store and apply different values for different configurations
